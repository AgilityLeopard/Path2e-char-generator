<h3>Groutt is Arrested</h3>
<p>After throwing Nootka across a crowd of people, Groutt is imprisoned in the sherrif's office. He throws his poop at his drunk cellmates, prompting the sherrif to enter the cell and break up the conflict. Groutt escapes from the cell, locking the sherrif in behind him.</p>

<h2>First Adventure: The Ruined Castle</h2>
<p>In a ruined castle built into a mountainside in the midst of The Great Stone Forest, our heroes encountered two feuding factions: a clan of kobolds and a horde of goblins. It seemed they would have to pick a side to remain in the castle. So they chose to help the kobolds by returning the dragon that had been stolen by the Goblins.</p><p> But when a troll entered the fray and chaos ensued, the adventurers were not loyal to the kobolds. Those involved in the midst of battle remained impartial until one side was clearly more powerful than the other. And while this battle served as a distraction, the adventurers who were not involved in combat pillaged the kobold's throne room. It was evident that these "heroes" were only looking out for their own self-interest.</p>

<h3>Groutt's Secret is Revealed</h3>
<h3>Erky is Rescued</h3>

  <h2>Ilane</h2>
  <p>This coastal nation, known for its wet climate and lush forests, is predominantly inhabitted by elves. While human traders and explorers from eastern nations have influenced much of the mainland's culture, traditional Elven customs have been preserved on its islands and the tips of its peninsulas. The country's economy prospers due to its strong agriculture, lumber, and fishing industries as well as its ability to ship goods overseas. 80% of goods shipped to and from Ouestmia across the Sea of Light pass through Oakvale.</p>

  <h2>Teluria</h2>
  <p>Once an impoverished Clypean province situated in the foothills of Mount Kragstrum, Teluria declared its independence in 1165. Since then this military powerhouse has expanded its territory north across the Naian River, logging half of the fey forest, as well as east into Byne, enslaving many of its halfling residents. Three years ago it annexed the small nation of Uruk, attracted by its militarily and economicly advantagous location in the mountain pass to Ilane.</p>
