            <h1>Tower Builder</h1>
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <ul>
                <p>In this game you will take turns to move builders and build portions of castle towers. If you are able to move your builder to the top of a completed three-storey tower, you win the game! You can also win the game if all your opponent's builders become trapped between towers and cannot make any legal moves.</p>
            </ul>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>On your turn you will perform three actions.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Select one of your builders to move</li>
                <li>Move the builder to an adjacent square. Builders can move forwards, backwards, sideways, and diagonally. Builders may move one level up or any number of levels down.</li>
                <li>Build a portion of a castle tower. Building on the ground will build a tower base. Building on a base will build a midsection. Building on a midsection completes the tower. If you build ontop of a completed tower, it becomes roofed. Roofed towers cannot be climbed on top of.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Note: to select builders, move, or build, click on the ground tile that they are above.</p>
