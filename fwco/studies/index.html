                        <p>
                            The objectives of the FSWP evaluation were to assess program design and implementation, including timeliness, consistency and transparency of selection; and the impact of the program to date at the immediate and intermediate outcome levels, including a preliminary assessment of the economic establishment of skilled workers, and whether they meet current and long-term labour market needs, while ensuring public safety and confidence in the program. The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the impact of changes made to the selection system for the program in 2002. The work included a detailed literature review on skilled immigrant workers both in Canada and other countries, a document review , interviews with 53 key informants, field visits to 5 Canadian Visa Offices Abroad (CVOA) including London, New Delhi, Hong Kong, Port of Spain, and Buffalo, a statistical analysis of the FOSS and CAIPS databases, an econometric analysis of the Longitudinal Immigration Database (IMDB), and surveys of 1,500 FSWs who participated in the FSWP as well as a sample of employers who had participated in the program.

                        <h2>Evaluation of Homelessness Partnering Strategy</h2>
                        <p>
                            The HPS seeks to address homelessness by working in partnership with communities, provinces and territories, other federal departments and the private and not-for-profit sectors. Through its community-based approach, the HPS provides communities with the flexibility and tools to identify and address their own distinct homelessness needs and priorities. HPS funding is invested in local priorities identified by communities thorough a comprehensive community planning process involving a range of local stakeholders. We were engaged to prepare an evaluation framework and conduct an extensive summative evaluation of the HPS.

                            The purpose of the evaluation was to examine the relevance and effectiveness of the Communicable Disease Control and Management (CDCM) Program within the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch for the time period 2008/04 to 2014/03. The evaluation was undertaken in three phases. The primary objective of the first phase was to prepare a detailed evaluation work plan that outlined the specific evaluation issues, indicators, data sources, and methodologies that were to be used. During the second phase, extensive literature, document and database reviews were undertaken and telephone interviews were conducted with a broad cross-section of 41 key representatives including staff from the national office, regional offices, representatives of the Public Health Agency of Canada and national program partners and experts.
