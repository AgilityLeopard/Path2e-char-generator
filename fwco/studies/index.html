                            The objectives of the FSWP evaluation were to assess program design and implementation, including timeliness, consistency and transparency of selection; and the impact of the program to date at the immediate and intermediate outcome levels, including a preliminary assessment of the economic establishment of skilled workers, and whether they meet current and long-term labour market needs, while ensuring public safety and confidence in the program. The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the impact of changes made to the selection system for the program in 2002. The work included a detailed literature review on skilled immigrant workers both in Canada and other countries, a document review , interviews with 53 key informants, field visits to 5 Canadian Visa Offices Abroad (CVOA) including London, New Delhi, Hong Kong, Port of Spain, and Buffalo, a statistical analysis of the FOSS and CAIPS databases, an econometric analysis of the Longitudinal Immigration Database (IMDB), and surveys of 1,500 FSWs who participated in the FSWP as well as a sample of employers who had participated in the program.

                        <p>
                            The HPS seeks to address homelessness by working in partnership with communities, provinces and territories, other federal departments and the private and not-for-profit sectors. Through its community-based approach, the HPS provides communities with the flexibility and tools to identify and address their own distinct homelessness needs and priorities. HPS funding is invested in local priorities identified by communities thorough a comprehensive community planning process involving a range of local stakeholders. We were engaged to prepare an evaluation framework and conduct an extensive summative evaluation of the HPS.

                            The evaluation of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program was designed to assess the continued relevance of the Program, its performance in achieving immediate and intermediate intended outcomes, and its performance in terms of efficiency and economy. To address the complexity of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program, the evaluation used multiple lines of evidence collected through interviews with 110 key informants including policy, program, and field staff from the three administering departments, provincial and territorial government representatives, third party representatives, and other stakeholders; surveys of 2,650 employers, 1,521 temporary foreign workers, and 159 third party representatives involved in the Program; literature review; document, file, and administrative data review; and 12 case studies each focused on a specific evaluation question or research area. The case studies relied on various lines of evidence collected through the evaluation, complemented with an additional 45 interviews with employer and government representatives.

                            The Industrial Research and Development Internship (IRDI) program creates private sector internship opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. During an internship, students receive a minimum stipend of $10,000 for a placement term of four months to six months. The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the relevance, achievement of expected outcomes, design, implementation, and efficiency and economy of the IRDI program, which provides grants and contributions to private sector companies to engage interns to assist in undertaking innovation and commercialization activities. The lines of evidence employed for the evaluation included document and literature review; review of administrative data on costs and participants; interviews with 52 key informants; surveys of 1,300 participants that included 536 interns, 353 sponsors and 411 supervisors; surveys of 20 prospective interns who applied but were not funded; and 7 focus groups and case studies that focused on achievement of outcomes and delivery. The evaluation results from the different lines of evidence were triangulated and summarized by each evaluation indicator and evaluation issue. Both thematic analysis for qualitative data and statistical analysis were utilized for the quantitative data.

                            The Department of Canadian Heritage (PCH) contributes to the Government of Canada’s Youth Employment Strategy (YES) through the YCW Initiative, created in 1997 to help young Canadians develop work skills and on-the-job experience in sectors aligned with the departmental mandate. The overall objectives of the YCW Initiative are to enhance participants’ knowledge and appreciation of Canada’s achievements and rich cultural heritage; to increase nationally the pool of skilled and qualified candidates for the cultural, heritage, and official language sectors; and to help young Canadians, through practical work experience, to develop their skills, enhance their employability, and learn more about their career options within the culture, heritage, and official language sectors. The objective of the evaluation was to provide comprehensive and reliable evidence on the ongoing relevance and performance (effectiveness, efficiency and economy) of the YCW Initiative. The lines of evidence employed for the evaluation included document and literature review; administrative data review including 10,000 employer exit survey entries and over 11,000 youth exit survey entries; survey of 1,707 of youth who participated in YCW; Survey of 1,029 employers who participated in YCW; and Interviews with 24 key informants. Multiple lines of evidence were triangulated and summarized by each evaluation indicator and evaluation issue.

                        <p>
                            The Velocity Adventure Program (Velocity) is an intervention program aimed at reducing anti-social behaviour, increasing attachment to school, and reducing substance abuse and contact with the criminal justice system among youth. The Program works with youth, ages 12 to 19 years, who are at-risk of, or have already been involved in, criminal activities. The objective of this evaluation was to determine the effectiveness of Velocity in reducing the targeted risk factors and examining the implementation, relevance and feasibility of conducting a cost effectiveness of this Program, and to measure the effects of the Program on the participating youth by assessing the extent to which the initiative is being implemented as intended; assessing whether the intended outcomes were achieved, and whether there were any unintended outcomes; providing a descriptive cost analysis for the project; identifying lessons learned, exploring what has worked well, what has not worked well and making recommendations to strengthen the project for the benefit of others interested in implementing or supporting a project of this nature in the future; and assessing the extent to which the project has been adapted to meet the needs of the youth/community.
